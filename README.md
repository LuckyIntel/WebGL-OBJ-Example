# WebGL-OBJ-Example
WebGL 2 example for OBJ model loading.

## How to run?
You basically download this repo, then double-click to open index.html file.That's it.Now it's up and working!Now click "Select File" and choose an OBJ file of your preference.

## Problems
1. Any obj file with more than 1 object/mesh results in a glitchy look.I am currently working on it.
2. No textures and normals.Planned to be added soon!
